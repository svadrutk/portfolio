Fantasy is my favorite genre. My first tattoo is the symbol for the Deathly Hallows 
from *Harry Potter*, and I grew up reading series like *Lord of the Rings* and 
*The Chronicles of Narnia*. Recently, I've gotten back into the genre and read things 
like *Ninth House*, *The Poppy War*, and *Fourth Wing*. One could say I've developed 
a bit of a standard for fantasy books I read:  

1. In-depth worldbuilding that isn't hard to understand.  
2. Compelling characters that don't just serve as a vehicle for the author to expound 
on their in-depth worldbuilding.  
3. Contains something that I haven't seen before in other fantasy novels—
“high fantasy” books are a dime a dozen and easy to replicate.  

This book checks all three.  

*The Jasmine Throne* follows two central characters: **Malini**, an exiled princess 
imprisoned by her zealot brother for refusing to bow to his rule and religion, and 
**Priya**, a maidservant with a secret, sacred past. Their lives intersect in 
the decaying temple-turned-palace where Malini is held captive and Priya works, setting 
off a chain of events that entangles them in rebellion, forbidden magic, and shifting 
allegiances.  

The story takes place in a fractured empire simmering with unrest. As old powers 
awaken and long-buried histories resurface, Priya and Malini must confront not 
only their personal demons but also the fate of an entire empire.  

What stood out most to me was how unapologetically **Indian** this book is. Not 
in a decorative or aesthetic sense, but in its bones. The characters have Indian names. 
The religious practices, festivals, food, languages, and power structures are all 
rooted in South Asian traditions. And none of it is filtered or over-explained for 
a Western reader—it’s just *there*. As it should be.  

As someone who’s Indian, it was honestly kind of healing to see our cultures and 
histories not only included but centered in a fantasy setting. It’s rare 
to read something that doesn’t feel like it’s trying to fit into the Eurocentric mold
just to be taken seriously.  

Another thing I loved: the central relationship is sapphic, and it’s powerful in 
all the right ways. It’s slow-burn, complex, political, and deeply emotional. 
As a queer Indian reader, it meant so much to see two brown women at the heart of 
a fantasy novel—*not* as side characters or tokens, but as protagonists shaping 
the world around them and falling in love on their own terms.  

Even if I weren’t queer, I’d still appreciate how carefully and beautifully 
it’s written. The relationship feels organic, earned, and real. It’s not performative —
it matters.  

*The Jasmine Throne* is the kind of book I wish had existed when I was younger. 
It’s lush, defiant, tender, and fierce all at once. If you love fantasy that’s 
emotionally intelligent, politically charged, and culturally rich, this 
is a must-read. I can't wait to dive into the rest of the trilogy.
