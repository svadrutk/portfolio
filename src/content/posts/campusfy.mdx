Over the past few months, I’ve been working on **Campusfy** — a platform built to help students make smarter, easier decisions about the classes they take. Think of it as a more interactive, intelligent layer on top of traditional course review sites, with features that go beyond just star ratings or vague comments.

Campusfy is a web platform where students can:

- Leave detailed class reviews based on workload, teaching style, and grading emphasis.
- Discover new classes based on interests, degree requirements, or instructor quality.
- Use AI-powered insights to plan out their semesters.
- Compare course difficulty and explore patterns across departments.

Right now, we're live for **University of Wisconsin–Madison** and **University of Utah**, but that’s just the beginning.

I’ve basically built the whole platform, but some of the things I’m most proud of include:

- **AI Advisor (Class Discovery Tool):** Built a smart filtering and recommendation system that helps students find courses based on what they actually care about (grading style, class size, reviews mentioning key terms, etc.)
- **Review Insights:** Aggregated and visualized grading patterns from hundreds of reviews to give students a quick understanding of class expectations.
- **Scalability Work:** Refactored parts of the architecture to make it easier to onboard new universities and support more user traffic.
- **User Experience:** Simplified review writing and browsing with a focus on clean UI, minimal steps, and fast performance.

We’re excited to share that Campusfy has hit a couple of early growth goals:

- **1,000+ unique visitors**  
- **Over 4,000 page views**  

For something that started as a side project with a few scrappy student developers, it’s amazing to see this kind of traction.

The next steps for Campusfy are all about **scale** and **value**:

- **Expansion to more schools**, starting with the University of Michigan. We’ve seen strong interest from students there, and we’re building out the backend support to make onboarding smooth.
- **More structured academic data:** We're looking into partnerships (or scraping alternatives if needed) to integrate course catalogs, professor schedules, and grade distributions to further enrich recommendations.
- **Monetization:** We're exploring ethically sound ways to monetize — possibly through career tools or degree planning services tailored to students’ actual coursework history.
- **Community features:** Think shared schedules, private recommendation lists, or alumni-backed reviews.
